## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn API implementation in a dynamic format. I built this for users who want a current day forecast and birds eye view of the week with a five day forecast. I learned how to connect an API to the script file and access the data via the fetch method and .then method to nest functions in a function. This solves weather data issues for the user as the user can pull the weather data from 200,000 locations according to OpenWeatherAPI.
